## Key Features

- **Owner Rooms:** Users have the ability to create personalized admin panels, known as owner rooms, where they can efficiently manage their drivers and vehicles.
- **Driver Trip Management:** Drivers can initiate trips and specify whether they are public or private. Public trips can be accessed by the general public through the link [dndrodhak.live](https://dndrodhak.live), allowing users to track the current location of the driver and stay informed about their whereabouts.
- **Real-time Driver Location:** Through the public user interface, users can view the real-time location of drivers during their public trips. This feature enables passengers to track the progress of their journey and plan their travel accordingly.
